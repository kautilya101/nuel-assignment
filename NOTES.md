## 🧩 Design and Architecture Decisions
- Used **React + Vite** with Tailwind for fast and consistent UI development.  
- Set up a **mock Apollo GraphQL server** for quick local prototyping using graphql and express.js .  
- Leveraged Apollo Client’s **built-in cache** to avoid extra state management libraries.

---

## ⚖️ Trade-offs During Development
- Chose a **mock backend**, trading real-world data complexity for faster iteration.  
- **Minimal testing** done to prioritize feature delivery speed.  
- Simple **client-side pagination**, less scalable for large datasets.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Build a **production-ready backend** with database, authentication, and secure APIs.  
- Add **server-side pagination, caching, and performance optimizations**.  
- Implement **testing, CI/CD pipelines, and real-time updates** for scalability.
